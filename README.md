# I wanna be programmer

This is not a tutorial but a collection of tasks suitable for self-teaching most programming language.

Even though most of the solutions are using [The Rust Programming Language][318aa7f0], none of the tasks is not suitable for any other programming language.

Choose a language and start with [Task 1](./0001/README.md).
